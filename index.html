          <h1>Sverdan Sviatoslav Volodymyr </h1>
          <p>Well, a few words about me. I am 24 years old, I live in Lviv,. I studied at NU LP, accounting and audit. Although this is popular in Ukraine, I do not have any desire to work in my specialty. Currently working as a car selection manager from the United States. I started learning frontend in january by recommendation of my friend. My way was pretty standard - i began with html and css and then continued with javascript on udemy course.</p>
          <p>I am interested in music, every year I visit the biggest music festivals in Ukraine, such as Zaxidfest, Faine Misto. As for other hobbies, these are trips to the Carpathians for a couple of days, with friends. When you are as close as possible to nature. These evenings surrounded by friends, around the fire, singing on the guitar is just incredible.Also During my student years, I often hitchhiked around Europe, so I visited 16 countries</p>

        <h2>I ’ M</h2>
        <p>
            looking for an internship in IT company.Ever since I was a 
            kid I've been trying to find a balance between creative 
            and technical things, for I loved both and found them 
            equally beautiful. 
            
            I love that it's fast developing and that there's a lot to 
            explore depending on various interests and needs. I enjoy 
            the idea that I can make an impact through writing code, 
            in a way transform and improve the lives of other people, 
            since problem solving is a big part of the job.
            
            Always eager to learn and quickly grasping new ideas. I 
            love being surrounded by creative people, so team-work 
            is one of the things that inspire me to do the job the 
            most! I am looking for constant improvement, therefore I 
            am not afraid of challenges</p>
